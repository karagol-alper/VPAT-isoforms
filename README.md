# VPAT-isoforms

Alternative splicing represents a potent mechanism for the post-transcriptional regulation of solute carrier function, yet the structural biophysics governing the Vesicular Polyamine Transporter (VPAT) interactome remain elusive. Here, we present a comprehensive thermodynamic and topological analysis of canonical VPAT and its splice variants (A0A3B3ITL9, A0A3B3IU67, A0A3B3IT67, and A0A3B3ISL3) utilizing explicit membrane Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with MM/PBSA free energy decomposition. We identify isoform A0A3B3ITL9 (10-TM) as a specific, equipotent competitive inhibitor of canonical VPAT homodimerization. While the canonical homodimer (ΔG bind=−29.29 kcal/mol) is stabilized by a conserved C-terminal hydrophobic lock involving Trp305 and Tyr244, the truncated ITL9 isoform bypasses this interface entirely. Instead, ITL9 exploits a conformational "interface switch" to recruit the VPAT N-terminus via a high-affinity electrostatic anchor at Arg3, resulting in a heterodimeric complex of identical stability (ΔG  bind=−30.10 kcal/mol). Conversely, we demonstrate that other isoforms are functionally segregated from this competitive pool: A0A3B3IU67 (11-TM) is destabilized by topological mismatch within the lipid bilayer, while A0A3B3IT67 (8-TM) functions as an inert allocrite driven by obligate soluble homodimerization. These findings define the VPAT regulatory landscape as a stoichiometric competition model, highlighting the N-terminal Arg3 pocket as a novel, isoform-specific equipotent therapeutic target for modulating polyamine transport.
